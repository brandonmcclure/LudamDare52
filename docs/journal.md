# Journal

Lets keep a journal of my development experience!

## 1/6 19:00

Install tailwind css. Setup a basic liveview, following [this](https://elixirprogrammer.com/learn/elixir-phoenix-liveview-counter-with-tailwind-css)

tests are all happy

I will keep the [live dashboard](localhost:4000/dashboard) for now.


start with adding in gamestate and individual user sessions

Done with work and family responsibilities. Officially starting the jam now. Theme is Harvest.

I mean stardew valley clone as a elixir clicker? I think a game where you choose what you plant, and then over time the crop is affected and how much you harvest will change. I would like to evolve the `harvest` concepts some more. We will start with growing corn, then add more fruits/vegtables.
I think a leaderboard for all the game sessions would be cool. People could easily "visit" other people's games.
Art style will be basic images made by me in gimp.

<https://github.com/da-coda/elixir-clicker> is the technical inspiration.

Forget documenting more, I just want to code!

## 1/6 10:00

Created a new empty pheonix project. Setup make targets to test/build the app.
